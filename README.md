    The Showcase

  <p align="center">
    This is a short collection of a few of the things I have worked on. Most of my best work has been done professionally on proprietary software I cannot share here, but here are a few of the things I have worked on in-between.

    Sales Tracker

    This is probably my most interesting project to talk about as it truly the most learning I have done in the fewest days. I worked on this a part of a 4 day group hackathon for our onboarding with Liberty Mutual, there were a total of 4 of us, two on the frontend, two on the backend, I worked on the frontend. This was my first time working with charts, I decided to learn Charts.JS while the others worked on either mocking data, setting up Models, Views, controllers or figuring out how to style the app. I really had to stretch my knowledge of React, this is where I learned exactly why understanding that setState runs async, that it uses referencial equation, and how to use helper functions within the frame of state manipulation was so important. One of the more fun challenges I had with this project was the loss of the backend, I could not possibly run the backend code for a public deploy, as the dependancies were in a library specific to LM's ecosystem, so I actually had to write a utility to come up with hundreds of randomized contacts so I could deploy this as a portfolio piece. If I were to re-write it now, I wouldn't change much honestly, the code needs cleaning, it's hard to read, there are some functions that could be condensed or combined, but I'm pretty proud of the work for only having had little less than 4 days to write it.

    Jewlery Designer
  </h2>
<p align="center">
  This is a project that I have been building as part of a family project, it is currently on hold, and thus development has stopped on it, it's certainly not my best or prettiest work but it still details an interesting part of my journey. Originally I built this out in plain ol' React, since first starting developmet it became ubundantly clear that React on it's own was not well suited for this sort of project, with plans for hundreds of images to be rendered at a time, as well as the expanding tech debt that is development in base react, I felt that using a SSR framework was a must and that it would make the development experience much better if I could write API routes within the same project. Thus I converted all of my react Syntax to Next syntax and learned how to develop in Next. Like I mentioned earlier, it's not super pretty, it's also not insanely technical, but I learned how to incorporate express functionalities into Next components. Now, it is worth mentioning that this is a full-stack app with an admin dashboard in the background, I have implemented full-crud into this.

  Thanks!

  If you've read this far I appreciate the time you spent here! Between constantly watching two toddlers and working diligently full time I really don't have time for an elaborate portfolio or super passionate portfolio pieces, but I felt I wanted something more than a CV to capture my joy and talent. So again,

<h1 align="center">Thank you!</h1>
